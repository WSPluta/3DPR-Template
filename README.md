# 3DPR-Template<br/>
This is a first Githubg so still trying to figure out how this works<br/>
3DPR is based on the Aframe Framework, along with the Aframe-extra components.<br/>
Other version have been built leveraging NAF component in order to add networking capabilities.<br/><br/>

3DPR is adding a new dimension to your presentation.<br/>
<b>Because we cannot move around anymore (due to COVID), It does not mean all our presentations need to be flat</b><br/>
